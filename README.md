<br>
* The idea of Book Vault is a digital book tracker, where you can save books to read/wishlist and write personal reviews and ratings. I often forget which books I have previously read so I was manually writing them down, I like to cut down on physical things I own - hence the digital booklist idea. <br><br>
* While researching this project I came across a few API's such as (Big Book API and Google API) that allow you to get book recomendations, something I would personally use a lot.<br><br>
* During my current internship I am learning a lot about API's, this is a great opportunity to put my experience into practise (REST API's, CRUD, and Unit testing). And using Next.js more advanced features such as: Incremental Static Regeneration. Which allows me to update the static content without rebuilding the entire site.

# User Story - MPV 
Read a book (physical book)  <br>  Go to Book Vault and search for the book<br>  Find the correct book and click "I've read"<br>  This will prompt you to a dropdown<br>  All infomation is optional but you can add: favouite quotes, a descriptive review, rating + more. Then click submit (The date you add is automatically added unless you want to change it.) <br><br>
