<br>
* The idea of Book Vault is a digital book tracker, where you can save books to read/wishlist and write personal reviews and ratings. I often forget which books I have previously read so I was manually writing them down, I like to cut down on physical things I own - hence the digital booklist idea. <br><br>
* While researching this project I came across a few APIs such as (Big Book API and Google API) that allow you to get book recommendations, something I would personally use a lot.<br><br>
* During my current internship, I have learned a lot about APIs. This is a great opportunity to put my experience into practice (REST AAPIs CRUD, and Unit testing). I am also using Next.Js's more advanced features, such as incremental Static Regeneration, which allows me to update the static content without rebuilding the entire site.

# User Story - MPV 
* Read a book (physical book) <br>
* Go to Book Vault and search for the book <br>
* Find the correct book and click "I've read"<br>
* This will prompt you to a dropdown<br>
* All information is optional but you can add: favourite quotes, a descriptive review, rating + more.<br>
* Then click submit (The date you add is automatically added unless you want to change it.) <br><br>
